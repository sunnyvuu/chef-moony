    <h1>Salmon Treats</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Homemade Cat Treats recipe has only three ingredients: salmon, egg, and flour– nothing more.<br>
    These Homemade Cat Treats only contain three ingredients, so they’re pretty simple to make! <br>
    The idea of making cat treats might be new to a lot of you, but it’s an easy process– <br>
    no different really from baking something for humans. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces canned salmon</li>
        <li>1 egg beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°.</li>
        <li>Pulse 10 ounces of undrained, canned salmon in a food processor to chop as finely as possible.</li>
        <li>In a stand mixer, combine salmon, 1 egg (beaten), and 2 cups whole wheat flour until dough forms. <br>
            If the dough is too dry, add up to 1/3 cup water. If it's is too wet or sticky, add a bit more flour.<br>
            The dough should be tacky but not sticky.</li>
        <li>Roll dough on a floured surface until about 1/4-inch thick. Use a 3/4-inch cookie cutter in the <br>
                shape of your choice to create your treats.</li>
        <li>Place treats on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake at 350° for about 20 minutes. <br>
        When they’re slightly browned and crunchy, they’re done.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool before serving.</li>
        <li>Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.</li>
    </ol>
